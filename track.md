## CASE STUDY 3
### HR / Workforce Analytics: Employee Attrition Prediction

### Background:
High employee turnover is costly: recruitment, training, and lost institutional memory all add up. Many companies want to predict which employees are at risk of leaving so that they can intervene (e.g., with retention bonuses, career development, improved work conditions). The IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset provides features on employee work metrics, satisfaction, demographics, and job roles.

### Problem Statement:
Use EDA to uncover which factors (e.g., job satisfaction, overtime, salary, work environment) are strongly associated with attrition. Then build a classification model to predict whether an employee will leave (attrition = Yes / No). Interpret your model to identify key drivers of attrition and suggest retention strategies.

Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.
